# The Theater
This project takes the [Code.org](https://code.org) Theatre
and breaks it free of the Java Lab so that you can use it in
Netbeans.

## What can I do with The Theater?
In Unit 4 of the Code.org AP CSA curriculum, students are
introduced to The Theater and explore its components and
functionality. Students use the classes and methods provided
by the Theater to play sounds, create drawings, and show
images. 

This version of the Theater takes that ability and brings
it to your local computer so that you can more easily integrate
version control, asset files, and the use of a professional IDE
as you choose.

## Where can I get documentation for the Theater?
[Code.org](https://code.org) provides some wonderful 
[documentation](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Theater)
for use with Java Lab, the same should cover this version.
